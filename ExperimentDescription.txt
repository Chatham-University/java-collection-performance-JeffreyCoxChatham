New Experiment:
Instead of simply making an array/vector/linkedlist and recording the time, there will be three tests for each collection type:
-Fill test, where the collection is made and populated (this is what was already being done).
-Read test, where a random element of the collection is chosen, read, and stored in a dummy variable. This is done howManyNums times.
-Write test, where a random element of the collection is chosen, and overwritten with a new random number. This is done howManyNums times.
Each of these will have their individual times recorded, and then the times of the three tests will be summed together to give a time for the collection as a whole.

Unfortunately, reading and writing to every element of a linked list takes an inordinate amount of time.
To circumvent this, I will instead do the read/write operation howManyNums/1000 times (so with howManyNums = 1,000,000, the operation is done 1,000 times).
Then, the time this takes will be multiplied by 1000 to approximate how long it would probably take.
Given the random distribution of the indices chosen, this approximation will likely be mostly accurate.

Finally, as a failsafe, the tests will be aborted after 1 minute.
